This project uses different predictive modeling techniques (i.e., generalized linear modeling and logistic modeling) to predict whether or not a Taylor Swift song from the Midnights album would be on the Eras Tour, based on a multitude of variables (i.e., danceability, BPM, song length, etc.). In this file, you will find the original dataset of all Taylor Swift songs with accurate indications of whether or not they are on the Eras Tour; this dataset is used to train the models. The attached RMarkdown file contains all of the code for the models themselves, and the final_predictions dataset has the estimated and actual values for whether or not a Taylor Swift song is on the Eras Tour (yes or no).
