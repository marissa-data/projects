Collection of materials from year-long, two-study, exploratory honors thesis project on the mutually beneficial relationship between faculty and student belonging. Raw data collection and analysis are confidential, but were completed through Qualtrics and R. Analysis techniques include parametric inferential tests of significance (t-tests, ANOVAs), post-hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni), and correlation (Pearson's r) tests. Findings include (but are not limited to): when faculty belong, they can create more inclusive classrooms, exude more warmth, and build pedagogical partnerships, all of which are facets of student belonging.
